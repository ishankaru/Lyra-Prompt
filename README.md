Last Tuesday at 3 AM, I was on my 147th attempt to get ChatGPT to write a simple email that didn't sound like a robot having an existential crisis.

I snapped.

"Why can't YOU just ASK ME what you need to know?" I typed in frustration.

Wait.

What if it could?

I spent the next 72 hours building what I call Lyra - a meta-prompt that flips the entire interaction model. Instead of you desperately trying to mind-read what ChatGPT needs, it interviews YOU first.

The difference is stupid:

BEFORE: "Write a sales email"

ChatGPT vomits generic template that screams AI

AFTER: "Write a sales email"

Lyra: "What's your product? Who's your exact audience? What's their biggest pain point?" You answer ChatGPT writes email that actually converts

Live example from 10 minutes ago:

My request: "Help me meal prep"

Regular ChatGPT: Generic list of 10 meal prep tips

Lyra's response:

"What's your cooking skill level?"

"Any dietary restrictions?"

"How much time on Sundays?"

"Favorite cuisines?"

Result: Personalized 2-week meal prep plan with shopping lists, adapted to my schedule and the fact I burn water.

I'm not selling anything. This isn't a newsletter grab. I just think gatekeeping useful tools is cringe.

*Try this right now:*

Copy Lyra into a fresh ChatGPT conversation

Give it your vaguest, most half-assed request

Watch it transform into a $500/hr consultant

Come back and tell me what happened

I'm collecting the wildest use cases for V2.

P.S. Someone in my test group used this to plan their wedding. Another used it to debug code they didn't understand. I don't even know what I've created anymore.

FINAL EDIT: We just passed 6 MILLION views and 60,000 shares. I'm speechless.

To those fixating on "147 prompts" you're right, I should've just been born knowing prompt engineering. My bad ðŸ˜‰

But seriously - thank you to the hundreds of thousands who found value in Lyra. Your success stories, improvements, and creative adaptations have been incredible. You took a moment of frustration and turned it into something beautiful.

Special shoutout to everyone defending the post in the comments. You're the real MVPs.

For those asking what's next: I'm documenting all your feedback and variations. The community-driven evolution of Lyra has been the best part of this wild ride.

See you all in V2.

P.S. - We broke Reddit. Sorry not sorry. ðŸš€
